# Ansi
Ansi is a small utility designed to assist in recalling colour escape codes by displaying terminal [ANSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code) escape code suffixes in their respective colors. These suffixes can be conveniently inserted into escape codes (e.g., `\x1b[<CODE>m` or `\033[<CODE>m`) to apply color formatting within a terminal.

## Usage
To utilize Ansi, simply execute the binary named `ansi`. This will display a list of ANSI color escape code suffixes along with their corresponding colors.
